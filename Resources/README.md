# Resources

In this directory you will find various electronic resources that will
be used in the course.

#### OCaml

We will make use of Jason Hickey's draft of a book that was not
eventually published.  But it is still a rather good resource and it
is free.  It is in the file `Intro-to-OCaml_Hickey.pdf`.

The article "OCaml for the Masses" by Yaron Minsky provides a
compelling discussion for using languages like OCaml in real world
applications where speed and correctness matter.
