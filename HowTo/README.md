# HowTo ...

The intention for this directory is to collect various "how-to"
documents that are needed during the semester.

Some of these may be contributed by you, the students in this course.

Examples include documents on how to use OCaml interpreters, how to
install OCaml on different operating systems, how to install OCaml
editing modes in different editors.  It is hoped that this information
can be carried forward to future instances of this course.


+ `How-to-use-OCaml.md` describes how one used OCaml on CSE labs
  machines.

+ `Git_SSH_Setup.md` describes how to setup your SSH key to
  authenticate with github.
